ðŸ’¬ About Me:
 
I work as a Frontend Developer at [YoungOnes](https://youngones.com/]), the digital platform where you can book an on-call worker for your day job within 5 minutes. With freelancers throughout the Netherlands, you as a client are always and everywhere quickly provided with flexible staff. The Frontend is built in React.js with a transition towards Next.js. Our state management is in React Query and for our styling we use SASS combined with TailwindCSS.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

More about styling and developing cool frontend components. I am using [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) for this as they provide fully designed components which I can then program.
