ðŸ’» About Me:

I currently work for Blink, a company that specializes in online platforms for primary and secondary education. My job is maintaining and developing the educational and innovative modules used on these platforms. The front-end is written in React, while the back-end is written in Node.js. In my leisure time I try to hone my developer skills with various projects which you can see on my Github and GitLab. I'm mostly interested in novel technologies and techniques, for example I recently have delved into Next.js and Kubernetes.
